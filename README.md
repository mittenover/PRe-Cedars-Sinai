# Research Project at Cedars-Sinai Hospital Center, Los Angeles

## Context
I worked as a **Research Associate Data Scientist** in Professor Nicholas Tatonetti’s team at the Cedars-Sinai Center during the summer of 2023, as part of my second year at ENSTA Paris. The Tatonetti Lab (TLab) focuses on enhancing drug safety through advanced data analysis, with the aim of identifying and preventing adverse drug reactions. You can learn more about their groundbreaking work on their [website](https://tatonettilab.org/).

Over the course of three months, I contributed to key projects aimed at improving drug safety. My primary contribution involved developing a model to detect novel **drug-drug interactions** by analyzing extensive databases of reported adverse events, supporting the lab’s mission to make medications safer for patients.

This repository contains some of the codes I used during my research internship at Cedars-Sinai.

## Brief description of the files
The Report.pdf is my research report submitted to the university. It provides a detailed description of the entire project, covering all aspects of my work.

The full_training.ipynb notebook outlines the algorithm for the complete training process of models, including hyperparameter optimization. This script enables the training of models on a large number of adverse events.

The Training for corroboration.ipynb notebook is designed to train specific models and obtain their corresponding outputs, which are then used to carry out validation on those models.

Finally, the ttest.ipynb notebook contains the code I used to perform the t-test as part of the model validation protocol.
